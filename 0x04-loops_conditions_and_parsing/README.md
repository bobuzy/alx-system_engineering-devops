## Task 0: Create a SSH RSA key pair

### Objective:
This task involves creating an SSH RSA key pair for accessing remote servers securely. The objective is to set up RSA public and private keys for SSH access to remote servers.

### Solution Code (`0-RSA_public_key.pub`)


## Task 1: For Best School loop

### Objective:
This task requires writing a Bash script that uses a for loop to display "Best School" 10 times. The objective is to practice using loops in Bash scripting for repetitive tasks efficiently.

### Solution Code (`1-for_best_school`)
The provided Bash script utilizes a for loop to iterate 10 times, each time echoing the string "Best School". Here's how the code works:

1. The `for` loop is initialized with the syntax `for (( i = 0; i < 10; i++ ))`, where `i` is the loop variable starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 9 (10 iterations in total).
2. Inside the loop, the `echo "Best School"` command is used to output the text "Best School" to the terminal.
3. After the loop completes all iterations, the script ends, having displayed "Best School" 10 times in the terminal.
